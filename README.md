# scottish-pb-webscrape

Following a conversation at work, I wanted to learn the very basics of webscraping. To keep it fairly relevant, here I attempt to scrape the names of public bodies from the Scottish Government Public Body directory.

Currently, the script just gets the names, and even then, it isn't quite working. I think this is because the subpages with the different types of PBs have slightly different HTML structures, so I need to fine tune it.

The table below summasrises the total number of public bodies identified by their type. There are definitely more than one "Other Significant Bodies", so that's one area where I need to look more closely.
